- Transport (optional)
- Vehicle No. (optional)
- Reverse Charge (if applicable)

Click "Add Item" to add more items.

### 5. Set Tax Details

- The application will automatically calculate CGST & SGST or IGST based on this selection

### 6. Save and Generate PDF

- Click "Save Invoice" to save the invoice to the database

## Managing Invoices

### View Invoices

Navigate to the "View Invoices" tab to see all saved invoices. From here you can:
- View invoice details
- Print/generate PDF of existing invoices

## Tax Calculation Logic

- For intrastate supplies (within the same state):
  - CGST = (Tax Rate รท 2)% of taxable amount
  - SGST = (Tax Rate รท 2)% of taxable amount
  - IGST = Not applicable

- For interstate supplies (between different states):
  - CGST/SGST = Not applicable
  - IGST = (Tax Rate)% of taxable amount

## Data Storage

The application stores all data locally in the following files:

- `invoices.db`: All invoice data
- `customers.db`: Customer information
- `products.db`: Product catalog

These files are located in the application's user data directory.

## Additional Features

- **Auto-calculation**: The application automatically calculates amounts, taxes, and totals
- **Amount in Words**: Automatically converts the invoice amount to words
- **Multiple Units**: Support for different units of measurement
- **PDF Generation**: Creates professional, print-ready invoices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure you have all required dependencies installed
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Permission issues**: If you encounter permission errors, try running with elevated privileges
   ```bash
   sudo npm start
   ```

3. **PDF generation fails**: Make sure you have write permissions to the selected output directory
